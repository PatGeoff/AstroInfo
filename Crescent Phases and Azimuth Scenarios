Crescent Phases and Azimuth Scenarios:

    Crescent on the Right:
        Position: Venus is between the Earth and the Sun.
        Azimuth: Less than 180° (eastern sky).
        Appearance: The crescent is illuminated on the right side.
    Crescent on the Left:
        Position: Venus is on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth.
        Azimuth: Greater than 180° (western sky).
        Appearance: The crescent is illuminated on the left side.

Other Possibilities:

    Gibbous Phase:
        Position: Venus is farther from the Earth than the Sun.
        Azimuth: Can be either less than or greater than 180°.
        Appearance: Most of Venus is illuminated, with a small crescent on the opposite side of the Sun.
        If azimuth < 180°, the crescent is on the left.
        If azimuth > 180°, the crescent is on the right.
    Full Phase:
        Position: Venus is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun.
        Azimuth: Typically around 180°.
        Appearance: Venus appears fully illuminated.
    New Phase:
        Position: Venus is very close to the Sun in the sky.
        Azimuth: Close to the Sun’s azimuth (either side).
        Appearance: Venus is not visible, as it is lost in the Sun’s glare.

Summary:
The orientation of the crescent (left or right) depends on both the phase of Venus and its azimuth relative to the observer.
In gibbous phases, the crescent can appear on either side depending on the azimuth.

Understanding Phase Angle (Phi):
Phase Angle (Phi): This angle is formed between the Sun, Venus, and the observer. It helps indicate how much of Venus is illuminated.
Determining Position:
Crescent Phase: If the phase angle is small (typically less than about 90°), Venus is likely positioned between the Earth and the Sun.
Gibbous Phase: If the phase angle is larger (greater than about 90°), Venus is on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth.
Summary:
By analyzing the phase angle, you can determine whether Venus is in a crescent phase (between the Earth and the Sun) or a gibbous phase (on the opposite side). This information, combined with the azimuth, helps you understand how Venus will appear in the sky.

Phases of Venus:
New Phase: Venus is between the Earth and the Sun, appearing mostly dark.
Crescent Phase: A small portion is illuminated, visible as a crescent.
First Quarter: Half of Venus is illuminated.
Gibbous Phase: More than half is illuminated, but not fully.
Full Phase: Venus is fully illuminated, positioned opposite the Sun.
